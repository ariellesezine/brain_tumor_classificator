# brain_tumor_classificator

In this notebook I have built a brain tumor classifier into 4 main classes : 'glioma', 'meningioma', 'notumor' and 'pituitary'

Creating a deep learning model for brain tumor classification aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and speed, leading to earlier detection and better patient outcomes. It helps reduce diagnostic errors by providing a reliable second opinion and supports radiologists by automating image analysis, thus streamlining workflows. Personalized treatment plans can be developed based on the model's insights, enhancing treatment effectiveness. Additionally, such models can advance research by offering new insights into tumor behavior and treatment responses. Ultimately, these models contribute to more cost-effective and equitable healthcare by improving access and reducing diagnostic costs.
